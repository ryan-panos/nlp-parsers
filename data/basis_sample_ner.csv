"Managing appointments and clients can be time-consuming for SMB owners and staff. Few weeks ago, we benefited from a GetData survey opportunity to ask their 500 US-based SMB panel what method were they typically using to manage their client appointments. Here are the results. SMBs like barbershops, beauty salons or doctors have long been dealing with booking issues with their clients such as: Thumbs up: Online calendars are a great way to keep a business owner and his team updated about any new appointments and to access it anywhere, anytime. Thumbs down: SMB owners have to keep dealing with clients on the phone and potentially lose time finding the right date & time to book an appointment. It doesnt provide any data on customers. Thumbs up: Staffs arranging appointments over email keep a trace of the conversation. They also have a contact with the client so that they can send them some promotions. Thumbs down: All the information exchanged over email isnt well organized. It becomes difficult for a business owner to organize his workday as he loses time searching for client emails. A new way to manage appointments, clients and staffs is starting to make its room in some small business shops. Thumbs up: This solution automates several time-consuming tasks that small business owners dont want to waste time with: With an appointment manager, businesses can set up automatic reminders and notifications so the client doesnt forget his appointment. It only shows the slots when staff are available so that clients doesnt waste time waiting for a staff confirmation. Clients can also book an appointment online even when the business is closed and benefit from a better customer experience. Staff can have access to the calendar to better anticipate each workday. A CRM is integrated in order to let businesses update detailed clients and appointments profiles for better client relationships. Finally, it also integrates email marketing functionalities to send clients some special offers and grow retention. Thumbs down: Often, business owners dont have the time to look for such a solution and get scared with digital implementations even though this isnt as complicated as it seems. Thumbs up: its an old method that cannot be altered with digital issues such as server problems. For efficient owners, maintaining a paper agenda updated and managing staff over paper is easy. Thumbs down: but it has its own limits. It has to be updated manually and isnt practical to carry out. It requires a huge discipline if the business has several schedules on the same agenda. Demographics: Over 500 US-based respondents from a panel of managers and owners of small and medium-sized businesses. Respondents are aged between 25 and 54 and have an average inferred annual income of $50k $150k."
"Jeffs a doctor who makes a ton of money and is aroused by not paying tax. This is contagious among medical people. So, lots of them earn their income through professional corporations, live on meagre dividends and shelter the cash so they pay only the lowly small business tax rate instead of handing over half to government. A day or two ago this blog started to explode that myth. Jeff deflated. Do you feel these corporations have no place in a financial plan as a tax deferral strategy, he asked? On the face of it, it would appear to me that ours is allowing us to accumulate wealth (inside a holding co.) more quickly than if we took the entire net of our business as salaries, paid the full personal tax rate, then invested the remainder. Are we fooling ourselves? Is it just an illusion of greater wealth, given that tax still needs to be paid on the full amount? Is this just a tax bomb thats going to go off when we retire (or before?) and the CRA treats the income of the holding co as passive and taxes it at the highest rate? I have an accountant and fee only financial planner, both of whom I trust, but Im always interested in differing opinions, especially from people who understand the Canadian tax system as well as you do. Its an interesting set of questions. Countless well-paid professionals think like the doc. They believe theyre gaming the system. Poor fools. Of course this aint just a medical thing. In our part-timer, contracted-out, no-job-security economy a growing number of people are not working for a corporate paycheque. Instead they sell their services to companies that dont want lots of messy, expensive, maternity-leave-taking, days-off-sick, vacationing, I-wanna-raise employees. Increasingly, these folks incorporate. The money they receive is not subject to withholding taxes, and the employer writes it all off without having to make EI or CPP contributions. Win-win. Maybe. This is where human emotion kicks in. Greed, mostly. Contractors whether theyre neurosurgeons or guys fixing motherboards dont want to pay the same tax as employees, so they usually end up taking living money as dividends, instead of income. This entitles them to the dividend tax credit, so they save tax. In reality, the dividends come from the after-tax earnings of their professional corporations. In other words, there was no tax saved because the corp paid half, and the corps owner paid the other half. In contrast, if the worker takes all of the pre-tax earnings as income, then the company would have paid no tax. But, of course, the owner would have paid a higher rate, on a higher amount plus earned RRSP room, which dividend income does not allow. Ironically, because contract workers almost never have a pension plan, theyre ideally suited to build up large RRSPs. In retirement (without a pension income stream) they can control their own income, collapsing those RRSPS in a careful and tax-efficient manner. Besides, every year they earn and make an RRSP contribution, they can write it off their taxable income, mitigating the bite. Of course, money inside an RRSP grows completely tax-free, as it does inside a TFSA. However money invested inside a small business is fully taxed at the business rate less than the personal one, however taxed nonetheless. But, it gets more complicated, because at some point all the money Jeff plans on amassing within his corp, so he can avoid taxation now, will have to move into his own hands. How do you plan on pulling that off, I asked him? And he said his scheme was to slowly take dividends from his company in retirement so hed never have to be in a high tax bracket. For a short time I actually ran Revenue Canada, Jeff, I said. Trust me They have this one nailed. Its hard to believe so many advisors and accountants are unaware, but thirty years ago the Income Tax Act was modified so contractors like the doc would not escape tax by sheltering money inside a small business corporation. One a company stops being active (bringing in revenue from operations) and becomes passive (making money from investments or rent, for example) the rules change. So the Tax Act imposes an income tax rate on a passive corporation that equals the top marginal rate paid by an individual which these days is roughly 50% in Ontraio. That means all investment income earned is treated the same as if it has been in the hands of the owner. The retired worker can still take income in dividends, and collect the dividend tax credit, but only after the corp has paid that top rate. So what is an active business? Its one that is not a personal services corporation, nor only invests or collects investment revenues. In other words, if you thought you could grow and shield money for your Harley-riding, pill-swallowing, Viagra-reliant, bionic knee and thirsty underwear years, forget it. So what should you do it you sell your services instead of your time? Dont assume a corp is the best structure. Youll pay more in professional charges, gain no relief from personal liability, and find its hard to ever shut down. Maybe a sole proprietorship might be the thing still allowing you to deduct expenses from earned income and way cheaper. Besides, you can earn RRSP room that way and end up with more retirement options. So, Jeff, its no tax dodge. You got bad advice. But your accountant gets to collect more fees. What a surprise."
"A labor dispute at a Silicon Valley recycling center could dramatically change who corporate America counts as an employee. The National Labor Relations Board ruled Thursday that companies using workers hired by another business such as staffing agencies, contractors or even fast-food franchises are still on the hook for labor violations and could be required to bargain with unions representing those employees. The NLRB's 3-2 ruling was handed down in the case of Browning-Ferris Industries, a Houston waste management company that used a subcontractor, Leadpoint Business Services, to staff its recycling center in Milpitas, Calif. The ruling determined that Browning-Ferris, which is part of Republic Services Inc., was a ""joint employer"" even though it didn't directly hire or have immediate control over people hired by Leadpoint. The decision will have far-reaching effects on the relationship between corporations and employees in America, especially at a time when many businesses are turning to temporary workers instead of hiring full-time employees. It's also a striking change from past labor laws, which doled out responsibility only to companies with direct control over hours, wages and working conditions for employees. Labor experts said many companies reliant on workers who are a few steps removed from their direct management will now have to rethink how they do business. In recent decades, labor advocates have been concerned that parent firms have been able to evade requirements for collective bargaining by outsourcing work to temporary staffing agencies or subcontractors. Many companies are going ""to take a hard look at their use of staffing agencies; their use of contractors and subcontractors; and if they are a franchiser, their business model with how they relate to franchisees,"" said Rebecca Bernhard, a labor attorney at Dorsey & Whitney. A lot of those companies depend on ""outsourcing"" labor to suit their needs, she said. ""Now that's not as viable of an option anymore."" The ruling benefits the growing slice of the American workforce working minimum-wage jobs or at temporary agencies. ""It's a great boon for contingent workers, which constitute such a growing part of our workforce and who are on the periphery,"" said William Gould IV, emeritus professor at Stanford University Law School and a former chairman of the NLRB in the 1990s. Gould said the previous standard was a much bigger hurdle for employees, who had to prove that the parent company had much more direct control over their operations in order to be considered a ""joint employer."" The decision applies not only to employees who want to engage in collective bargaining but also to those who simply want to protest unfair working conditions. ""It will impact workers who have never even thought about the collective bargaining process but simply say, 'I want you to change the conditions here, the wages, the heat in the facility, which I think are wrong,'"" Gould said. ""The boss can't say, 'Hey, I'm going to penalize you for doing that.'"" The ruling could change operations of high-profile companies in a diverse group of industries, such as Wal-Mart, which subcontracts out warehouse work, and franchise-heavy companies such as McDonald's and Burger King. Business groups and companies immediately lambasted the NLRB's ruling as a politically driven maneuver that will hurt the economy. The three Democrats on the board voted for the ruling and the two Republicans voted against. ""Small business subcontractors and franchisees provide millions of jobs for American workers,"" the National Retail Federation said in a statement. It's ""just one more example of unelected government bureaucrats creating roadblocks in the path of job creation and economic growth."" McDonald's, for its part, emphasized that the definition of a joint employer does not apply to the burger chain, even though the NLRB last year said that it did. That's the same reasoning that many fast-food companies have used to distance themselves from the protests for a higher minimum wage that have swept through the country in the last few years. ""We do not have the authority to direct or co-determine the hiring, firing, wage rates, hours, or any other terms of employment of our franchisees' employees,"" McDonald's said Thursday. The ruling also amps up the potential bargaining power of unions, which have lobbied to expand the definition of which companies could be considered a joint employer. ""It tilts things somewhat more in the union's direction,"" said Daniel J.B. Mitchell, former director of UCLA's Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. Starting in the 1980s, companies increasingly began using workers from temporary-staffing agencies as if they were regular employees, Mitchell said. ""The lines began to blur about what makes you an employee of one employer versus another."" ""If you've got one employer supplying employees, but the other employer is telling them when to report and what to do, they begin to look more like they're the employee of the party that's actually in control,"" he said. The decision was cheered by the Teamsters, the union that wanted to organize the recycling center workers at the heart of the ruling. It maintained that Browning-Ferris had enough sway over the working conditions and pay of those employees, even if they were hired by another company, to qualify as a joint employer. ""Employers will no longer be able to shift responsibility for their workers and hide behind loopholes to prevent workers from organizing or engaging in collective bargaining,"" Teamsters General President Jim Hoffa said. The ruling could kill much of the appeal of staffing agencies, which have boomed in recent years. Many businesses, burned by hard times during the recession, remain reluctant to expand their payroll and are instead turning to temporary workers. The Affordable Care Act heightened the appeal of temporary workers; corporations utilizing their services were not responsible previously for providing health insurance. ""Now we have a question of who is the employer,"" attorney Bernhard said. ""If the NLRB says they are both employers, which one has to give health insurance?"" But before any of these effects are felt, labor experts say corporations in the direct line of impact will be duking it out in the courts. ""They will fight it to the end,"" said John Alan James, chairman emeritus of Pace University's Center for Global Governance, Reporting and Regulation."
"LAS CRUCES &GT;&GT; ""How much money do I need?"" Entrepreneurs frequently face this question when planning a new business startup. Too little, and you risk running short of cash and derailing your venture before it even gets started. Overestimating your needs has drawbacks too, as a higher amount may necessitate additional debt with its associated costs. Though the surplus may be put to good use elsewhere in the business, the extra liability could still weigh down your balance sheet at a time when you want to be running as lean as possible. Good budgeting and financial planning can help any small business right-size its funding needs. But how can a start-up with no experience make the most accurate projections possible? Former building materials industry executive and veteran SCORE counselor Lou Davenport, recommends using SCORE's free spreadsheet templates with built-in formulas to prepare pro-forma forecasts for the first three years of operation. The spreadsheets include expense categories for start-up and ongoing operations, enabling the user to plan for each step of the transition into a sustainable small business. ""Once you learn how to use them, it's much easier to do 'what-if' scenarios and compare the results,"" Davenport says. ""You can then use the first-year projections as your budget, and track things as you go along."" In making start-up financial projections, Davenport recommends paying particular attention to balance sheets and cash flow forecasts. ""For example, you may determine that $30,000 will get a business started,"" he says. ""But if it takes a year and a half to break even, it may well take another $30,000 to reach that point. Not recognizing and planning for these situations is a serious error."" Once you've determined your start-up's financing needs, you can identify the best source(s) for acquiring it. Many entrepreneurs rely on their own savings, while others look to their local banks for SBA-backed business loans. There are several other options to consider as well: Angel investors and venture capital firms. These are individuals or groups who lend money or acquire an ownership interest in a small business, usually one with the potential for rapid growth and high returns. Credit cards. Though convenient, credit cards usually have high interest rates. If you're a sole proprietor, missed payments could damage your personal credit standing. Friends and family. Another convenient source, but loans must be wisely structured to avoid damaging personal relationships. Crowdfunding. An Internet-based method where small business ideas are pitched to a cooperative pool of potential investors. Increasingly popular, crowdfunding nevertheless has limitations and currently lacks regulatory protections against fraud. Grants. No federal program gives ""free"" money solely to start a new business. However, state and local-level programs can help offset certain costs (e.g., office and production space, investing in energy-efficient technologies). Locating a business in a designated enterprise zone or one undergoing economic revival may also earn tax credits and reduced rates for rent and utilities."
"One of the primary focuses of my administration has been providing meaningful tax relief for hardworking Nebraskans. Whether I am visiting with ranchers at a coffee shop in Chadron or a small business owner at a town hall event in Falls City, I hear firsthand how Nebraska's high taxes impact communities, businesses and families across our state.Easing tax rates even slightly can make a big difference because it keeps more of your paycheck in your pocket. It helps the small business owner who is looking for a way to expand their operation or the family trying to find enough money in their budget to make their rent or mortgage payment.These are the type of stories that motivated me to make property tax relief my number one focus this past legislative session. Our efforts were met with success, and my proposal to deliver over $400 million in property tax relief Ò a more than 45 percent increase over past budgets Ò through the Property Tax Credit Relief Fund received legislative approval. This will provide tax relief for all Nebraska property owners. The tax credit will be applied to your tax bill directly, and many will see the credit noted on their bills for their 2015 property taxes.While this tax relief was significant and a step in the right direction, there is more still to be done. The Tax Foundation's 2015 State Business Tax Climate Index ranks Nebraska as 29th best in overall tax competitiveness as well as 12th highest in property taxes and 26th highest in income taxes.These rankings show that Nebraska is a high-tax state, and is, at best, middling when compared to other states. There is nothing competitive about being middle-of-the-pack, and we must continue to look for new ways to bring tax rates down so that we can provide tax relief that will keep hardworking families here in our state and create more high quality jobs.Right now, members of the Legislature are studying education funding and property taxes to develop proposals for the upcoming legislative session. Last year, numerous proposals to make structural changes to how we levy property and income taxes were introduced by senators; however, no proposals that provide long-term structural relief advanced from the Revenue Committee. This fall, senators have already discussed a wide variety of potential tax reforms ranging from a property tax revenue freeze to calculating land valuations on a 10-year average instead of the current 3-year average. The conversation has only just begun, and senators will welcome your input as they continue to talk about potential proposals that could impact your tax bills.As we approach next year, my team is working with legislative groups interested in tax reform, talking to tax experts and preparing tax reform proposals. In the coming weeks and months, I would encourage you to share your property tax bill with your local and state representatives as you have conversations with them.Because property tax is a locally administered tax, long-term relief will require cooperation from both state and local government. As we continue to look for ways to improve Nebraska's tax competitiveness, I hope that you will share your ideas on tax reform with my office at pete.ricketts@nebraska.gov and 402-471-2244."
"Posted at by PConran on category Insurance Insurance helps cover you financially in times of tragedy, illness, or in the event of an accident. You can get insurance coverage for so many different things. You can have insurance for your life, home, vehicle, and even your beloved pets. When accidents occur, insurance helps in paying unexpected costs. You will be able to find out what each kind of insurance will do for you! Bundle your insurance policies to save money. Bundled policies qualify for discounts with many insurers. The most common is probably a bundle that includes auto and homeowners insurance at a reduced rate. As you compare your options, inquire about discounts and reduced rates for policy holders who take out both auto insurance and homeowners insurance. Proper insurance is vital for the small business owner. Many policies give you coverage for most of the risks that could potentially take placem but there are a few risks that may not be covered. You may want to talk to another company or adjust your policy, so that all potential risks are covered in your policy. In order to obtain a speedy response to your insurance claim, you should be as detailed as possible when explaining your circumstances. Photograph any and all damages you report. Do not make things look worse to get more money. Your insurance agent will find out and you will be in trouble. Having a higher deductible may give you a lower premium, but it can be costly down the road. While you have the advantage of lower monthly premiums, you are going to be fully responsible for small incidents. Remember to consider these small expenses when deciding the best choice for yourself. To get the best insurance rates, check the prices at several companies and find the policy that offers the coverage you need. Make sure that you are educated on insurance providers and what plan is best for your needs. As one learns more about the different types of insurance, one improves their chances of getting the best plans possible. Every year, you should go over the details of your insurance policy to verify that it accurately reflects your needs. For example, its possible to take the collision coverage off your vehicle that has gotten older, been paid off, or has dropped significantly in value. If there have been changes in your family size or medical needs, you may want to adjust your insurance accordingly. If your circumstances require you to change providers or policies, you should verify that you will still be covered during the transition. You do not want to risk having any period of time when you do not have insurance coverage because of a gap between your termination of one policy, and the effective date of your new policy. Having full insurance coverage is well worth the cost of the premiums. If you have multiple policies with the same insurance company that company will often offer discounts of between 10 and 15 percent off your total premiums. Get a quote from them and compare it with a few other companies and simply go with whichever one is cheapest. Investigate insurers who offer bundled services such as car, home, boat and sometimes life insurance. Many times these will carry a discounted rate. This not only prevents people from having to deal with multiple companies, but reduces their rates, too. Letting your insurance company know that you never smoke or drink may qualify you for discounts. A car alarm cuts risk of theft, and is also a money saver for insurance. Be sure to check and make sure youre getting every discount available to you. As stated at the beginning of the article, there are many different types of insurance available. Hopefully you have discovered ways you can insure yourself and/or your property that you hadnt thought of before. Having insurance gives you piece of mind that in the unfortunate event of a tragedy, illness, or accident, you and your family will be covered, and a bit more prepared."
"In most cases, if you do something yourself, you can save money. Even though you may save money by choosing to file taxes on your own, it is wise to hire a tax preparation expert such as a certified public accountant, an enrolled agent or a tax attorney. By working with professionals who offer tax services San Francisco, CA residents can benefit in many ways. One benefit of using the services of professional tax preparers is minimizing the hassles of filing taxes. Filing taxes can be a complicated task. For example, if you own a small business and you want to itemize your deductions, you need to complete a number of forms requiring information from previous tax returns. Filing taxes can also take a lot of time and you may end up making a mistake. If you hire a professional, he or she can help you reduce mistakes. Some of the mistakes that people make include entering tax payments on the incorrect line, simple mathematical errors and computation errors when calculating taxable income. If there are errors in your return, the refunds you are eligible for can be delayed. If the mistake results to tax liability, penalties and interest will begin to accrue from the date you filed your tax returns. With the help of a professional, the chances of making mistakes can be reduced. Tax laws are also complicated. For instance, before a person uses a deduction or credit, he or she must qualify for it. Professional tax preparers assist their clients to find the credits and deductions they qualify for and advise them about certain issues. For instance, if their clients are eligible to use both tuition deductions and education credits, but are only allowed to use one of them, they can help them decide which one to take. As people sign the end of their tax returns, they have to state that the information contained in them is true and accurate. If the IRS audits the returns of a person and finds errors, he or she can face serious repercussions. Taxpayers can avoid such consequences if they hire a professional tax preparation service provider. The professional can evaluate their tax returns to make sure that all figures are correct. In order to file their taxes successfully, San Francisco residents should hire a competent tax preparer. Before hiring a professional, they should carry out a background check. They can do this by contacting the state board of accountancy if they are hiring a CPA or contacting the Better Business Bureau. They should consider if any complaints have been filed against the professional they want to hire. The other important thing to do is to verify credentials and qualifications. Professional tax preparers are required to have a preparer tax identification number. You should also find out if the preparer belongs to any professional organization, his or her level of experience and education background. Besides finding a reputable and competent tax preparer, you should also hire a professional who you can easily work with. You should also ask him or her for references. You can contact the people listed as references and find out whether they were satisfied with the services they received from the preparer.

"Posted at by PConran on category Insurance From medical and car insurance to homeowners, dental, vision and even life insurance, there are a wide range of insurances available. Read on to learn how to choose the types of insurance that are right for you, with policies that give you the coverage you need. Get fresh quotes before buying or renewing an insurance policy, and save money. Each insurance company will differ in their criteria for premiums and discounts. The result of such a wide variety in criteria equates into a huge selection of prices, leaving you open to take what you feel suits you most. Get several insurance quotes every year to make sure you are getting the best rate. Insurance companies will usually lower your premiums if you use them for your life, home and auto insurance. Insurance carriers usually offer discounts, and one that is common is to offer a cut in cost if you have more than one policy with the company. So if you are in the market for new policies, make sure you ask for home and auto quotes simultaneously and discover what your potential savings are. Proper insurance is vital for the small business owner. Most policies cover many risks, but not everything. If there is something not covered, consider finding another policy that will cover what you need covered. Clearly explain what happened to get a quick response to your claim. You should also take clear photographs of the damage. Do not create or even elaborate details of the accident, and never do additional damage in hopes of getting a larger settlement. Falsifying a claim is illegal. When you are searching for insurance, check if your state provides insurance rates and information from different companies. When you do this, you will gain good, general knowledge of the appropriate price range for you. Establish a budget beforehand and find the prince-range from each company you query, thus providing an initial process of elimination. To help the insurance claim process go smoother, keep documentation and records during the whole process. Make sure you document all conversations you have with your insurance company in order to know the progress of the claim. Follow up on phone conversations or face to face visits with a letter to affirm what they told you. Keeping your credit score in good shape will help you get better rates on insurance. Your credit history can influence your premiums. If youre considered high-risk by the credit agencies, the insurers will see you that way too and will raise your premiums. Check out your policy regularly, and make sure it is up to date. Get quotes from several agents to see if they can offer you lower rates. These types of things that you do not need to pay for can end up costing a significant amount over time, so review your policy to be sure it is correct. Now you are more aware of the various insurance products that are available on the marketplace. While choosing insurance may be incredibly complex and sometimes overwhelming, it is an important aspect of life that protects you should disaster ever strike you or your family."
