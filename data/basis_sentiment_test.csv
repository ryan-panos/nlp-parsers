"These tealight holders are nice, but they vary A LOT from candle holder to candle holder (of course, they're handmade). I ordered two candle holders and they aren't the same height or color. One holder is more orange and the other is basically white with some pink. Tealight candles fit easily into the holes. Although the colors vary so much, they both still glow an amber color when lit. One of the holders arrived in a damp cardboard box; which was weird, considering you're not supposed to get them wet. It doesn't seem to have affected the candle holder, though. As far as emitting positive waves of energy, well, that's still to be seen. Regardless, they look neat both lit and unlit."
"I ordered two of these and both are slightly different but thats to be expected since they are naturally carved. The photo is slightly misleading as it shows the candle holder to be a rosy color and mine were much more whitish with a very slight pink hue to them. I use flameless votive candles in them so am not sure if I am getting the benefits of the salt without burning real flames, but I like them just the same and would get them again. The are nice and chunky in size and both had openings easily large enough to accommodate votive candles or the flameless kind."
"Of the two candle holders I received, one was in perfect condition. I love it, and have had no problems fitting the tea candle in. It creates a beautiful ambiance, and is the perfect centerpiece for my table. Unfortunately, the other candle holder arrived damaged, and was fractured such that it was inevitable that it would chip further. I do love the unbroken one though, and was able to get a refund for the entire purchase."
"I bought these when they were 1.50 each including shipping. One came broken in half, and the broken one was a much lighter shade of pink than the one that arrived whole. I did not complain because I was only out 1.50, and since they are pretty heavy I didn't want to waste anyones time or money on shipping. The one I do have is really nice, and totally worth $3, lol. I took my chances despite a lot of people claiming they arrived broken, since I usually have pretty good luck. Not so this time, but if you get it cheap enough it really doesn't matter."
"These are amazing! They look great and give a nice ambience to a room. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because one of the candle holders had a crack in it and the only way I found out was I put a candle in there and the wax seeped out of the bottom where the crack was. Otherwise I really love these."
"I ordered a few of these the quality control was hit and miss. First one I got had a huge long hair wrapped around it inside the plastic it arrived in. Understandable stuff like that happens but kind of gross to see upon removing from the box considering I was gifting it to someone. The second I purchased and had to return because the opening wasn't large enough to insert a tea light candle. The third one I received had no hair and was large enough for a candle but is pretty much a white salt candle with barely any hint of the pink/coral. It's still pretty but you just never know what to expect when you order!"
"I purchased a set for myself and was very happy with them. I purchased a second set for others, however one was broken upon arrival and I missed the time frame to return it, so that's a little disappointing, however, they are priced so low that I doubt I would find even a single one at this price. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase, I use them frequently ... It seems like they will last forever. Will probably purchase again in the near future. Anyone know how to fuse a broken one back together again?"
"Pretty medium peach color. Rustic, irregular shape. Has nice veins and variation of color. However, it only illuminates from where the candle rests. I use the tin enclosed tea light candles. The smooth, globe shaped salt crystal is completely illuminated where as this one is only half illuminated. The candle burns well in it and burned for 5 hours. In my opinion, this candle holder is as pretty un lit as it is lit. I may try a tealight in the clear plastic holder to see if it makes a difference. But I think the rounder, globe holders are prettier."
"I really like how these tealight holders look when I'm burning a tealight candle. They deliver a beautiful orange glow that feels very cozy and relaxing. The only thing is one of the holder has a small crack down the entire length and up the other side. However, it does NOT seem to be affecting the performance of the holder, and I don't think it will get worse. These candle holders are very durable and unique, which I appreciate. I really like how they look and hope to enjoy them for years to come."
"I bought it because I had frequent irritation in my nose in the winter, the heat and dryness in the house I guess. A friend of mine recommended it but I thought it would be useless. But, I offered it to a relative for xmas and she showed me how cute and relaxing it was. I bought one and my nose stop to be dry without humidifier. It healed a sore that was bleeding in my nose. I was very pleased. The reason I give 4 star, it' that the hole to place the tealight is deep and it's hard to light it up. But for the "air purifier" and "relaxation", it's quiet true. Even my husband stopped to sneeze. I recommend it but it's a bit hard to light it up."
